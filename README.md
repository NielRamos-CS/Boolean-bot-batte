Boole Bots Game
Welcome to the Boole Bots Game! This is a fun, interactive game where bots battle against each other using Boolean logic operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT). The bots are controlled through user-defined configurations, and the game features a leaderboard to track the bots' performance based on their wins.

#Features
Bot Configuration: Users can create and configure bots with unique names, Boolean operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT), initial values (0 or 1), and speed settings.
Arena: A 5x5 grid where bots are randomly placed. Bots move randomly and collide with each other.
Battle System: When two bots collide, their results are determined based on their Boolean operation, and the winner is declared.
Leaderboard: Displays the number of wins and losses for each bot, dynamically updated after each battle.

#How to Play
Add Bots: Click the "Add Bot" button to create bots. Customize each botâ€™s name, value, operation, and speed.
Start the Battle: Once you've added bots, click the "Battle!" button to start the game. The bots will start moving and colliding in the arena.
Watch the Results: When bots collide, their results are calculated using the selected Boolean operation, and the winner is determined. The leaderboard will be updated accordingly.
Bot Configuration Details
Bot Name: Name your bot.
Value: Choose either 0 or 1.
Operation: Choose one of the following Boolean operations:
AND: Performs an AND operation with the bot's value.
OR: Performs an OR operation with the bot's value.
XOR: Performs an XOR operation with the bot's value.
NOT: Performs a NOT operation (inverse) on the bot's value.
Speed: Controls how quickly the bot moves within the arena. A range from 1 to 10 is provided.

#How It Works
Each bot has a random position in a 5x5 arena grid.
The bots move in random directions, and when two bots collide in the same grid position, their results are determined by their Boolean operations.
The winner is determined based on the result of the operation. The bot with the higher result wins, and the loser is removed from the arena.
The leaderboard is updated after each battle, showing each bot's wins and losses.****
